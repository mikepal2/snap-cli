This folder contains samples demonstrating the usage of the SnapCLI library.

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [minimal](./minimal/Program.cs) | The "Hello World" sample. |
| [quotes](./quotes/Program.cs)  |  This program is based on the sample from the System.CommandLine [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/get-started-tutorial#add-subcommands-and-custom-validation) (scroll down to `The finished app looks like this:` section). It is functionally equivalent to the original code but adapted to use the SnapCLI library, demonstrating how it simplifies development, readability, and maintenance of the CLI application code. |
| [inventory](./inventory/Program.cs) | Sample CLI application for inventory bookkeeping. |
| [base64](./base64/Program.cs) | Multi-command CLI example for base64 encoding and decoding. |
| [parameterized-main](./parameterized-main/Program.cs) | CLI example with parameterized Main() method |
| [classic-main](./classic-main/Program.cs) | CLI example with class Main() method behavior |
