# SnapCLI

This library provides a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) API. It is built on top of the [System.CommandLine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/) library.

# NuGet package
The library is available in a NuGet package:
- [SnapCLI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SnapCLI/)

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to enable developers to create POSIX-like Command Line Interface (CLI) applications without the need to parse the command line themselves, allowing them to focus on application logic. The library automatically handles command-line commands and parameters using the provided metadata, simplifying the development process. It also streamlines the creation of the application's help system, ensuring that all necessary information is easily accessible to end users.
 
 The [DragonFruit](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/main/docs/DragonFruit-overview.md) project was a step in this direction, but is very limited in abilities it provides.

# API Paradigm
The API paradigm of this project is to use [attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/) to declare and describe CLI commands, options, and arguments.

Any public static method can be declared as a CLI command handler using the `[Command]` attribute, and effectively represent an entry point to the CLI application for that command. Any parameter of command handler method automatically becomes a command option. See the [usage](#usage) section and examples below for more details.

## What about classes?
Many CLI frameworks require separate class implementations for each command. In my opinion, creating individual classes for each command adds unnecessary bloat to the code with minimal benefit. Using attributes is easier to maintain and understand, as they are declared close to the entities they describe, keeping all related information in one place. Additionally, attributes allow for extra details, such as descriptions and aliases. Since the goal is to simplify usage as much as possible, I decided to avoid using classes. While this approach may not be as flexible as some alternatives, it effectively meets the needs of most CLI applications. Additional customizations can be made with the [startup](#startup) code.

## Command line syntax
Since this project is based on the [System.CommandLine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/) library, the parsing rules are exactly the same as those for that package. The Microsoft documentation provides detailed explanations of the [command-line syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax) recognized by `System.CommandLine`. I will include more links to this documentation throughout the text below.

It is recommended to follow System.CommandLine [design guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#design-guidance) when designing a CLI.

## Main method  
Typically, the `Main` method serves as the entry point of a C# application. However, to simplify startup code and usage, this library overrides the program's entry point and uses command handler methods as the entry points instead. This means you don't need to write any startup boilerplate code for your CLI application and can dive straight into implementing the application logic, i.e. commands.

Itâ€™s important to note that since the library overrides the entry point, if you include your own `Main` function in the program, it will **not** be invoked. If you need some initialization code to run before command, it can be placed in [Startup](#startup) method. 

If you really need to use your own `Main`, you can still do so:
1. Add `<AutoGenerateEntryPoint>false</AutoGenerateEntryPoint>` property into your program .csproj file
2. Call SnapCLI from your `Main()` method as follows
    ```csharp
    public static async Task<int> Main(string[] args)
    {
          // your initialization here
        ...
    
        return await SnapCLI.CLI.RunAsync(args);
    }
    ```

# Usage

## Commands
A [command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#commands) in command-line input is a token that specifies an action or defines a group of related actions. Sometimes commands may be reffered as *verbs*. 

Any public static method can be declared as a CLI command handler using the `[Command]` attribute. 

```csharp
[Command]
public static void Hello() 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

Additional information can be provided in attribute parameters to enhance command-line parsing and the help system, such as the command's explicit name, aliases, description, and whether the command is hidden

```csharp
[Command(name:"hello", aliases:"hi,hola,bonjour", description:"Hello example", hidden:false)]
public static void Hello() 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

Async handler methods are also supported. 

The library supports handler methods with the following return types: `void`, `int`, `Task<int>`, `Task`, `ValueTask<int>`, and `ValueTask`. The result from handlers returning `int`, `Task<int>`, and `ValueTask<int>` is used as the program's exit code.

```csharp
[Command(name:"sleep", description:"Async sleep example")]
public static async Task<int> Sleep(int milliseconds = 1000)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Sleeping...");
    await Task.Delay(milliseconds);
    Console.WriteLine("OK");
    return 0; // exit code
}
```

**Command name convention**

- If the `[Command]` attribute does not specify a command name:
  - If this is the only command in the program, it is automatically treated as the [root command](#root-command).
  - If there are multiple commands declared, the method name, converted to [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), is used as the command name. For example, the method `Hello()` will handle the `hello` command, while method `HelloWorld()` will handle `hello-world` commmand.
  - If the method name constains underscores (`_`), it declares a [subcommand](#subcommands). For example, a method named "order_create()" will define a subcommand `create` under the `order` command.
- If the name specified in the `[Command]` attribute explicitly contains spaces, it declares a [subcommand](#subcommands). For example, `[Command(name:"order create")]` defines `create` as a subcommand of the `order` command.
- Commands may have [aliases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#aliases). These are usually short forms that are easier to type or alternate spellings of a word.
- Command names and aliases are [case-sensitive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#case-sensitivity). If you want your CLI to be case insensitive, define aliases for the various casing alternatives.

## Options
An [option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#options) is a named parameter that can be passed to a command.

Any parameter of command handler method automatically becomes a command option. In the next example `name` becomes option for command `hello`:

```csharp
[Command(name:"hello", aliases:"hi,hola,bonjour", description:"Hello example", hidden:false)]
public static void Hello(string name = "World") 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!");
}
```

Additional information about an option can be provided using the `[Option]` attribute, including an explicit name, aliases, a description, and whether the option is required.

```csharp
[Command(name:"hello", aliases:"hi,hola,bonjour", description:"Hello example", hidden:false)]
public static void Hello(
    [Option(name:"name", description:"The name we should use for the greeting")]
    string name = "World"
) 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!");
}
```

**Required options**

Required options must be specified on the command line; otherwise, the program will show an error and display the command help. Method parameters that have default values (as in the examples above) are, by default, translated into options that are not required, while those without default values are always translated into required options. You may force option to be required using `required` parameter of the attribute.

**Option name convention**
- The option name is automatically prepended with a single dash (`-`) if it consists of a single letter, or with two dashes (`--`) if it is longer, unless it already starts with a dash.
- If option name is not explicitly specified in the attribute, or attribute is ommitted, the  name of the parameter, converted to [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), will be used implicitly. For example, for the parameter `userId` the default option name will be `--user-id`.
- Options may have [aliases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#aliases). These are usually short forms that are easier to type or alternate spellings of a word.
- Option names and aliases are [case-sensitive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#case-sensitivity). If you want your CLI to be case insensitive, define aliases for the various casing alternatives.

**What do we have so far?**

With the full program source code consisting of just a few lines:
```csharp
using SnapCLI;

class Sample
{
    [Command(name:"hello", description:"Hello example")]
    public static void Hello(
        [Option(name:"name", description:"The name we should use for the greeting")]
        string name = "World"
    ) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!");
    }
}
```

We get complete help output:
```text
> sample hello -?
Description:
  Hello example

Usage:
  sample hello [options]

Options:
  --name <name>   The name we should use for the greeting [default: World]
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information
```

We may run the command without a parameter (default name value `World` is used):
```text
> sample hello
Hello World!
```

And we may may run command with the a parameter:
```text
> sample hello --name Michael
Hello Michael!
```

## Arguments
An [argument](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#arguments) is a value passed to an option or command without specifying an option name; it is also referred to as a positional argument.

You can declare that a parameter is an argument using the `[Argument]` attribute. Let's change "Option" to "Argument" in our example:

```csharp
[Command(name:"hello", description:"Hello example")]
public static void Hello(
    [Argument(name:"name", description:"The name we should use for the greeting")]
    string name = "World"
) 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}!");
}
```

Now we don't need to specify `--name` option name.
```text
> sample hello Michael
Hello Michael!
```

Also, note how the help message has changed:
```text
> sample hello -?
Description:
  Hello example

Usage:
  sample hello [name] [options]

Arguments:
  [name]  The name we should use for the greeting [default: World]

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information
```

**Argument name convention**
- Argument name is used only for help, it cannot be specified on command line.
- If argument name is not explicitly specified in the attribute, the name of the parameter, converted to [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case), will be used implicitly.

You can provide options before arguments or arguments before options on the command line. See [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#order-of-options-and-arguments) for details.

## Arity
The [arity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#argument-arity) of an option or command's argument is the number of values that can be passed if that option or command is specified. Arity is expressed with a minimum value and a maximum value.

```csharp
[Command(name: "print", description: "Arity example")]
public static void Print(
    [Argument(name:"numbers", arityMin:1, arityMax:2, description:"Takes 1 or 2 numbers")]
    int[] nums
)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Numbers are: {string.Join(",", nums)}!");
}
```

<details>
<summary>Sample output</summary>

```text
> sample print -?
Description:
  Arity example

Usage:
  sample print [numbers]... [options]

Arguments:
  [numbers]  Takes 1 or 2 numbers

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information
```
```text
> sample print 12
Numbers are: 12!
```
```text
> sample print 12 76
Numbers are: 12,76!
```
</details>

## Global options
Any public static propety or field can be declared as global option using the `[Option]` attribute.
By default, global options are not required because properties and fields always have default values, either implicitly or explicitly. You can make a global option required by using the `required` parameter of the attribute.

```csharp
class Sample
{
    // This global option is not required and have explicit default value of "config.ini"
    [Option(name:"config", description:"Configuration file name", aliases:"c,cfg")]
    public static string ConfigFile = "config.ini";

    // This global option is not required and have implicit default value of (null)
    [Option(name:"profile", description:"User profile")]
    public static string Profile;

    // This global option is always required
    [Option(name:"user", description:"User name", required:true)]
    public static string User;

    ...
}
```

## Root command
The [root command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#root-commands) is executed if program invoked without any known commands on the command line. If no handler is assigned for the root command, the CLI will indicate that the required command is not provided and display the help message. To assign a handler method for the root command, use the `[RootCommand]` attribute. Its usage is similar to the `[Command]` attribute, except that you cannot specify a command name. There can be only one method declared with `[RootCommand]` attribute.

The description for the root command essentially serves as the program description in the help output, as shown when program is invoked with the `--help` parameter. If the root command is not declared, **SnapCLI** library will use the assembly description as the root command description.

```csharp
[RootCommand(description: "This command greets the world!")]
public static void Hello()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

> **_NOTE:_** If a program has only one command handler method declared with `[Command]` attribute and the command name is not explicitly specified in the `name` parameter of the attribute, **SnapCLI** library will automatically set this command as root command.

## Subcommands
Any command may have multiple subcommands. As mentioned earlier, if command name includes spaces or if the name is not specified and the method name contains underscores, it will describe a [subcommand](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/commandline/syntax#subcommands). 

In the following example we have a subcommand `world` of the command `hello`:

```csharp
[Command(name:"hello world", description:"This command greets the world!")]
public static void Hello() 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

Or equivalent using just method name:

```csharp
[Command(description:"This command greets the world!")]
public static void hello_world() 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

The usage output will be as follows:

```text
> sample -?
Description:

Usage:
  sample [command] [options]

Options:
  --version       Show version information
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  hello
```
```text
> sample hello -?
Description:

Usage:
  sample hello [command] [options]

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  world
```
```text
> sample hello world -?
Description:
  This command greets the world!

Usage:
  sample hello world [options]

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

```
```text
> sample hello world
Hello World!
```

## Commands without handlers
In the output above we have description for the `hello world` command, but not for the `hello`. To describe the `hello` command without assigning a handler method you may use `[Command()]` attribute at the top of the class containing handler methods.

Similarly, you can provide description for the root command (the first description in the output above) using `[RootCommand()]` attribute at the top of the containing class.

With descriptions provided as shown in the following example, the help output will be complete.

```csharp
[RootCommand(description: "This is a sample program")] // or [assembly: AssemblyDescription(description: "This is sample program")]
[Command(name: "hello", description: "This command greets someone", aliases: "hi,hola,bonjour")]
class Sample
{
    [Command(description:"This command greets the world!")]
    public static void hello_world() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

## The CLI execution order
The `SnapCLI` library takes responsibility for initialization and execution of the CLI application. There is no need to write any startup boilerplate code and you don't even need to write [Main](#main-method) method for the application.

The steps during CLI initialization and execution are as follows:

1. The `SnapCLI` library scans assembly for `[RootCommand]`, `[Command]`, `[Option]`, `[Argument]`, and `[Startup]` attributes.
2. The `System.CommandLine` parser is initialized, and the commands hierarchy is built based on the attributes found.
3. The [Startup](#startup) method(s) are executed, if present.
4. The command line is parsed.
5. [Global options](#global-options) are set according to command line parameters.
6. The [BeforeCommand](#beforecommand) event is invoked.
7. The command handler corresponding to command specified on command line is executed.
8. The [AfterCommand](#aftercommand) event is invoked.
9. The process is exiting.


## Startup
You may declare a method to perform additional initialization using `[Startup]` attribute. This method will be executed before command line is parsed. The startup method is recognized by its attribute rather than its name; in other words, you can name it anything you like.

```csharp
[Startup]
public static void Startup()
{
    // additional initialization for your code
    ...
}
```

The startup method may have a parameter of type `CommandLineBuilder`. If you choose this alternative, you must configure `CommandLineBuilder` yourself, typically using the [.UseDefaults()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.commandline.builder.commandlinebuilderextensions.usedefaults?view=system-commandline#system-commandline-builder-commandlinebuilderextensions-usedefaults(system-commandline-builder-commandlinebuilder)) extension method.

```csharp
[Startup]
public static void Startup(CommandLineBuilder commandLineBuilder)
{
    // additional initialization for your code
    ...

    // disable posix option bundling
    commandLineBuilder
      .UseDefaults()
      .EnablePosixBundling(false);
}
```

The `CLI.RootCommand` property, which provides access to the command hierarchy along with their options and arguments, is available in the startup code for further customization.

> **Important:** When the startup method is invoked, the command line has not been parsed yet; therefore global parameters still have their default values and not the values from the command line, and `CLI.ParseResult` property is not accessible.


## BeforeCommand

The `BeforeCommand` event is invoked after the command line is parsed and before the command handler is executed. It allows for any additional common initialization, validation ot preprocessing the program may need before executing any command. With the command line parameters already parsed, global options reflecting the values specified on the command line and the `CLI.ParseResult` is accessible for validation or to access options and arguments.

The `BeforeCommand` event handler receives a `BeforeCommandEventArguments` parameter with the following member:
* `ParseResult` - The command line parse result.

To register a `BeforeCommand` event handler, use the following code:

```csharp
[Startup]
public static void Startup()
{
    CLI.BeforeCommand += (args) => {
        // common initialization or validation before executing any command
        ...
    }
}
```

## AfterCommand

The `AfterCommand` event is invoked after the command handler is executed. It allows for any common deinitialization or post-processing the program may need after executing a command. The event handler receives an `AfterCommandEventArguments` parameter with the following members:

* `ParseResult` - The command line parse result.
* `ExitCode` - The exit code to return from the CLI program. The handler may change the exit code to reflect specific execution results.

To register an `AfterCommand` event handler, use the following code:

```csharp
[Startup]
public static void Startup()
{
    CLI.AfterCommand += (args) => {
        // Common deinitialization or post-processing after executing any command
        ...
    };
}
```

## Exception handling
To catch unhandled exceptions during command execution you may set exception handler in [Startup](#startup) method. The handler is intended to provide exception diagnostics according to the need of your application before exiting. The return value from handler will be used as program's exit code. For example:

```csharp
[Startup]
public static void Startup()
{
    CLI.ExceptionHandler = (exception) => {
        var color = Console.ForegroundColor;
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        if (exception is OperationCanceledException)
        {   // special case
            Console.Error.WriteLine("Operation cancelled!");
        }
        else if (g_debugMode)
        {   // show detailed exception info in debug mode
            Console.Error.WriteLine(exception.ToString());
        }
        else 
        {   // show short error message during normal run
            Console.Error.WriteLine($"Error: {exception.Message}");
        }
        Console.ForegroundColor = color;
        return 1; // exit code
    };
}
```

## Validation

There are multiple strategies to validate command line input. Input values can be validated at the beginning of the command handler method in any manner required by the command syntax.

```
[Command]
public static void command([Argument] int arg1 = 1, int opt1 = 1, int opt2 = 2) 
{
    if (arg1 < 0 || arg1 > 100)
        throw new ArgumentException($"The <arg1> value range is 0-100");
    ...
}
```

Additionally, the library provides mechanisms to check for mutually exclusive options and arguments:

* The `mutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments` parameter of the `[Command]` attribute can be used to declare a list of mutually exclusive option/argument names separated by spaces, commas, semicolons, or pipe characters. If there are multiple groups of mutually exclusive options/arguments, they must be enclosed in parentheses.
  ```
  [Command(mutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments="(opt1,opt2)(arg1,opt2)")]
  public static void command([Argument] int arg1 = 1, int opt1 = 1, int opt2 = 2) 
  {
      ...
  }
  ``` 
* The `ParseResult.ValidateMutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments()` method can be used from within the command handler method.
  ```
  [Command]
  public static void command([Argument] int arg1 = 1, int opt1 = 1, int opt2 = 2) 
  {
      CLI.ParseResult.ValidateMutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments("(opt1,opt2)(arg1,opt2)");
      ...
  }
  ``` 
* Alternatively, the `ParseResult.ValidateMutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments()` method can be used from the [BeforeCommand](#beforecommand) event handler.
  ```
  [Startup]
  public static void Startup()
  {
      CLI.BeforeCommand += (args) => {
          args.ParseResult.ValidateMutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments("global-opt1,global-opt2");
          args.ParseResult.ValidateMutuallyExclusiveOptionsArguments("(global-opt1,opt2)(opt3,opt4)");
          ...
      };
  }
  ```
